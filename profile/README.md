# The PerformanC Organization

## Welcome

Welcome to The PerformanC Org, we're a organization focused on making libraries with an incredible performance, compability and security.

We for now only make C libraries, but not limited to, and all PerformanC projects are licensed with the same license, which can be seen in any repository.

## Projects

We've made a lot of projects till this point, take a look at a list of some interesting ones:

1. [TableC](https://github.com/PerformanC/TableC) - An Open and closed addressing hashtable for C focusing on being light-weight.
2. [Coglink](https://github.com/PerformanC/Coglink) - Lavalink client for Concord, using a simple but flexible API.
3. [CThreads](https://github.com/PerformanC/CThreads) - (WIP) Cross-platform thread library using pthreads (POSIX) and Windows threads.

## PerformanC libs vs general

PerformanC softwares are not made to be popular, famous, with a lot of stars, but to have an awesome stability, and with the best performance it can have.

And differently from most libraries, instead of focusing on not changing the method of usage, we do, for good reasons, to improve performance, stability, and etc.
